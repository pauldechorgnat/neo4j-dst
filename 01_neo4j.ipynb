    "Relational databases have been around since the 70s. They are well developped, well documented. They are great to use for reprensenting relations betweens different entities. Yet, they require a strict schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, developpers may require different storing facilities. Especially given the variety of data created, a \n",
    "strict schema for the data you want to store might be a liability. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to store user activity on a website. This website is going to evolve, have mew pages, new features. If you want to keep track of the using of those new features, you might have to update the schema of your database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lately, a lot of emphasis has been put on NoSQL databases that allow for more flexibility on the data schema and thus permit to manage data with a wide range of formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL DBMS consist in a wide range of technologies, techniques and paradigms but we can see three main families. \n",

    "<blockquote>\n",
    "Graph databases is very different from other NoSQL database management system (DBMS): it focuses on relationships between pieces of data: observations are represented as nodes of a graph while relationships are reprenseted by edges. This allow for different algorithm to be used such as <b>shortest path algorithms</b>, <b>centrality computation</b> or <b>community detection</b>... \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some graph DBMS: the most used is Neo4J but OrientDB, ArangoDB, Apache Giraph are also known DBMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Example of a graph: social networks</h4>\n",
    "<i>One of the main example of those databases and the use of such algorithms are social networks: social networks are all about relationships between individuals and out of the structure of the surrounding individuals, we can draw a lot of insights.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Let's imagine a Twitter-like social network: people can follow other people but the relationship is not necessarily mutual. Our social network contain 4 people: Alice, Bob, Clementine and Daniel. Their relationships are the following: </i>\n",
    "<i>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>Alice follows Bob.</li>\n",
    "        <li>Bob follows Alice.</li>\n",

    "        <li>Daniel follows everyone.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "</i>\n",
    "<i>On the following figure, people are reprensted by circles and follows are represented by directed arrows: those are respectively the nodes and the edges of the graph.\n",
    "</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"./example_graph.png\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>We can figure out pretty easily which person is the most important but when the graph is thoussands and thoussands of nodes large, we need complex algorithms, storing facilities and a specific computing engine to do the same thing.</i>\n",

    "One of its main advantages is that data is natively stored in a graph fashion: the storage is optimized for graph algorithms.
